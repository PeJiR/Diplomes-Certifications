                                <p>Downey was born April 4, 1965 in Manhattan, New York, the son of writer, director and
                                    filmographer Robert Downey Sr. and actress Elsie Downey (née Elsie Ann Ford).
                                    Robert's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one
                                    quarter Irish, descent, while Robert's mother was of English, Scottish, German, and
                                    Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film
                                    and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the
                                    Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving
                                    to California with his father following his parents' 1978 divorce. In 1982, he
                                    dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr.,
                                    himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr.
                                    would go on to struggle with abuse for decades.</p>
                                <p>Downey Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970),
                                    written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire
                                    throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Tuff Turf (1985), Weird Science (1985),
                                    True Believer (1989), and Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992, Downey
                                    received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for
                                    Best Actor for his performance in the title role of Chaplin (1992).</p>

                                <p>Despite his active drug and alcohol addiction, Downey Jr. made a name for himself as
                                    a young actor in the mid- to late ‘80s. After a season in the cast of “Saturday
                                    Night Live,” he scored film roles in the likes of John Hughes fare such as Weird
                                    Science, and he co-starred opposite Molly Ringwald in The Pick-Up Artist in 1987.
                                    That same year, Downey also gave a memorable performance in the film adaptation of
                                    the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero, playing a rich kid whose life went off
                                    the rails amid a severe heroin addiction. Downey’s off-screen life would soon
                                    uncannily resemble that role.</p>
                                <p>Downey’s performance in the 1992 biopic Chaplin earned him an Academy Award
                                    nomination, and his career seemed to be on an upward trajectory until 1996, when he
                                    was arrested for possession of heroin and cocaine. As reported in a 2003 interview
                                    with the New York Times, Downey was arrested multiple times for drug offences and
                                    cycled in and out of jail.</p>

                                <div class="biography__bg biography__bg--alcohol"></div>
                                <p>One of the more disturbing incidents involved an intoxicated Downey wandering into a
                                    neighbor’s house and passing out in a bed. After repeatedly missing court ordered
                                    drug tests, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison stint in 1999, but only
                                    ended up serving a year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State
                                    Prison.</p>
                                <p>In 2001, while on parole, Downey was found barefoot, wandering around Culver City,
                                    California and was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence. That incident
                                    led to him being fired from his role on the TV show “Ally McBeal,” in addition to
                                    other film and stage jobs. Instead of being sent back to prison, the now-broke actor
                                    was ordered to rehab.</p>

                                <p>Downey’s wife Susan Downey (née Levin) told Harper’s Bazaar that he quit drugs for
                                    good in 2003 after she gave him an ultimatum. Apparently, it stuck. According to a
                                    2013 Daily Mail article, the actor credits a combination of 12-step programs, yoga,
                                    meditation and therapy with keeping him sober.</p>
                                <p>His career didn’t pick up again until Mel Gibson personally underwrote Downey’s
                                    liability insurance…</p>
                                <p>He also credits sobriety for the phenomenal career momentum he has enjoyed over the
                                    past few years. In the early aughts, it was practically impossible for Downey to get
                                    hired since most filmmakers wouldn’t—or couldn’t—pay the exorbitant insurance bonds
                                    it required to have him on set. His career didn’t pick up again until Mel Gibson
                                    personally underwrote Downey’s liability insurance so that the actor could star in
                                    2003’s The Singing Detective.</p>
                                <p>
                                    From there, Downey started working steadily, appearing in films such as Gothika, A
                                    Scanner Darkly, Zodiac and Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang.</p>
                                <p>Downey’s star-power rose in 2008 when he starred in the summer blockbusters Iron Man
                                    and Tropic Thunder, earning his second Oscar nomination for the latter. Downey then
                                    starred in The Avengers and subsequent Iron Man movies, making him a critical player
                                    for Marvel.</p>
                                <p>The fact that Robert Downey Jr.’s career seems to improve the longer he stays sober
                                    makes his comeback one of the most impressive and inspiring stories.</p>

                                    The Avengers, also known as the Heroes of New York, were a team of extraordinary
                                    individuals, either with superpowers or other special characteristics. Its purpose
                                    is to protect world stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats, and to work
                                    with the peaceful interests of the whole world rather than a specific country or

                                <p class="personal__text">Downey has been a close friend of Mel Gibson since they starred in Air America. Downey defended Gibson during the controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said "nobody's perfect" in reference to Gibson's DUI. Gibson said of Downey: "He was one of the first people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go see what we can do to work on ourselves.'" In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.</p>

                                <p class="music__text">The Futurist is the debut studio album by American actor Robert
                                    Downey Jr., produced by Jonathan Elias and Mark Hudson, and released on November 23,
                                    2004 through Sony Classical. The album debuted at number 121 on the Billboard 200
                                    chart, selling 16,000 copies in its first week.</p>
                                <p class="music__text">The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that
                                    he probably will not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing
                                    the album was not compensated. He explained that he did not want to spend whatever
                                    time he had at home in the studio, but rather with his family. "Broken" plays during
                                    the end credits to Downey's 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.</p>

                                but now with this album you seem to be joining actors like Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan
                                and William Shatner, who think they have crossover appeal as recording artists. Why put
                                out an album?</p>
                            <p class="music__interview-text"><b>ROBERT DOWNEY JR.:</b> Yeah, there is this thing about
                                people wanting to continually demonstrate their prowess in many areas and it's kind of a
                                gross-out. Clearly, I have some hesitation in being an actor who puts out an album. But
                                after years of writing songs, it gradually became more real. Then after I got a record
                                deal -- and strangely the guy who was heading it up at Sony, Peter Gelb, was not a
                                sleazebag -- I couldn't stop it once I said, "Where's my advance money?"</p>

                                room that had a piano in it, and I thought I should occupy myself more wisely than
                                sitting on the circa-1970 couch and staring out the window.</p>
