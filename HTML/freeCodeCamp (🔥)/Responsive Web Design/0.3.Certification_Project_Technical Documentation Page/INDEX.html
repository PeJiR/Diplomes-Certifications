        At its heart,
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a>
        is a language made up of
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>
        ,which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a
        bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document
        into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content
        such as images and videos into a page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
        fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
