### Description:

>This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game implemented in Python. The game can be played by two players, who take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

**Features** :

Two-player support
Command-line interface
Basic game logic
Error checking

**Installation:**

To install the game, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/PeJiR/Professional-Certificates.git


**Usage:**

To play the game, simply navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

    python project.py

You will be prompted to enter the names of the two players. The game will then begin, and the players will take turns placing their marks on the board.

**Controls:**

To place a mark on the board, simply enter the row and column number of the space you want to mark. For example, to place your mark in the middle space, you would enter 2 2.

**Winning the Game:**

The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board is full and there is no winner, the game is a draw.

**Design Choices:**

The design choices for this project were made with the following goals in mind:

Simplicity: The game should be easy to play and understand for players of all ages and skill levels.
Fairness: The game should be fair and balanced for both players.
Portability: The game should be playable on any platform that has a Python interpreter.

**Additional Considerations:**

In addition to the design choices listed above, the following considerations were also made when developing this project:

Error checking: The game should prevent players from making invalid moves, such as placing their mark in a space that is already taken.
Code quality: The game code should be well-written and easy to maintain.

**Conclusion:**

This project is a simple but complete implementation of a tic-tac-toe game in Python. The game is fair, portable, and easy to play. The code is also well-written and easy to maintain.
