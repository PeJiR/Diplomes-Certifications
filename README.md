## Intro 

This repository contains a collection of all the professional certificates that I have earned so far. I am passionate about continuous learning and development. 
I believe that professional certificates are a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in my field, and to demonstrate my skills and knowledge to potential employers and clients.
